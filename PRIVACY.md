**Effective Date**: 1/10/2024 
**Last Updated**: 1/10/2024

## Introduction

The **Real-Debrid Manager** extension respects your privacy and is committed to protecting any data it collects. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our extension.

## Data Collection

### Current Version
- **User Data**: The extension collects and stores your Real-Debrid API key locally on your browser using Chrome's Storage API. This data is not transmitted to any external server.
- **Cache Data**: API responses from Real-Debrid are temporarily cached locally to improve performance.

### Future Plans
We may introduce tracking to collect usage statistics, monitor events, and log JavaScript errors or issues to improve the extension's functionality and user experience.

## Data Usage

### Current Version
- The Real-Debrid API key is used solely to authenticate requests to the Real-Debrid API.
- Cached data is used to reduce API calls and enhance performance.

### Future Plans
- Usage and error tracking data will be used to:
  - Identify and fix bugs or issues in the extension.
  - Understand how users interact with the extension to guide future improvements.

## Data Sharing

### Current Version
- No user data is shared with any third party.

### Future Plans
- If tracking and error monitoring are implemented, anonymized data may be shared with a trusted analytics or error monitoring service (e.g., Google Analytics, Sentry). Any such integration will be disclosed in this privacy policy.

## Your Data Rights

- You retain full control over your Real-Debrid API key and can delete it at any time by clearing the extension's data in your browser settings.
- If usage and error tracking are introduced, users will be notified, and tracking will only occur with explicit user consent.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be communicated through the Chrome Web Store listing or directly in the extension.
